The pipeline of the proposed segmentation framework is shown in Fig.1. We adopt
nnUNet as the basic network models for IAN segmentation. Self-training method
is adopted for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. In addition, a connectivity-based
selective re-training strategy is designed to screen more plausible pseudo-labels.  

## Environments and Requirements:
### 1. Install and deploy nnUNet
